## 2.1 Observe

- Run the program and use the time counter to measure the time usage
- Use the large data to guess and verify the mathematical model

## 2.2 Mathematical Model

### 2.2.1 Time

The time usage is connected to 

- The time usage of the operation of each statement.
- The frequency of each statement being operate.

#### 2.2.1.1 Approximation

We use $\sim f(N)$ refer to when N grows, the result of divided by $f(N)$ equals to $1$,
use $g(N) \sim f(N)$ refer to when N grows, the result of $g(N)/f(N)$ equals to $1$

#### 2.2.1.2 Inner Loop

- The inner loop refers to the operation which the program execute the **MOST** frequently
- The program's time usage depens on the inner loop.

#### 2.2.1.3 Cost Model

- The cost model refers to the basic operation of the algorithm
- Such as 3-sum, the cost model of 3-sum is the frequency of access the array element

#### 2.2.1.4 The step of gain the mathematical model

1. Verify the **input model**, and the size of the problem
2. Identify the **inner loop**
3. According to the inner loop, to verify the **cost model**
4. Accroding to the input model, verify the frequency of each operation

#### 2.2.1.5 The classification of the growing level

![Classification](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/14analysis/images/classifications.png)

1. Constant

> Most of the Java operation

2. Logarithmic

> A little slow than the constant, such as **BinarySearch**

3. Liner

> The single `for` loop

4. Linerithmic

> Such as the `Merge.sort()` and the `Quick.sort()`

5. Quadratic

> Two `for` loop, such as `Selection.sort()`, the `Insertion.sort()` and the `Bubble.sort()`

6. Cubic

> Three `for` loop, such as the **3-sum**

7. Exponential

> Very slow, try to avoid to use it.

#### 2.2.1.6 Build the faster algorithm

> The ***Divide and Conquer Algorithm*** to solve 3-sum problem
    
- 2-sum problem

> if the result of 2-sum is zero, there must be $ A + B = 0 $
or $A = -B$
So, we can use **BinarySearch** to find the opposite number of the specific number.

Notes:

> if the return value of **BinarySearch** is in the range $ 0< return < spec$ it means we **refind** the previous number, the number is **redundancy** , we should **abort** it

> So, we reduce the running time from the $N^2$ level to the $logN$ level

- 3-sum problem 

> As the 2-sum, when the $-(a[i] + a[j])$ is the part of the array, nor the $a[i]$ or $a[j]$, and the pair $(a[i], a[j])$ is the part of the 3-sum.

> By using the BinarySearch, we reduce the running time from the  $N^3$ level to the $N^2logN$ level

#### 2.1.1.7 The prediction of running time in growing levels

| Describe   | Function | Modulus is 2  | Modulus is 10 | Handle the 10N | Handle 10N in 10 times faster|
|--------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|
| Linear| $N$|2|10| a day| couples of hours|
| Linearrithmic|$NlogN$|2|10|a day | couples of hours|
| Quadratic| $N^2$| 4| 100| a few weeks| a day|
| Cubic| $N^3$ | 8 | 1000 | a few months | couples of weeks|
| Exponential| $2^N$ | $2^N$ | $2^{10N}$ | forever | forever

#### 2.1.1.8 The notice of algorithm analysis

1. Big constant number

    > Normally, we suppose that $2N^2 + cN$ is $\sim 2N^2$, but when c is equal to $10^3$ or $10^6$, that is incorrect.

2. No decisive inner cycle

    > The wrong cost model cannot get the correct analysis result.

3. Time of instructions

    > If you are using the ARRAY to access some number which doesn't nearby, it might cost a lot of time

4. The system cause

    > When you are running your program to analysis the algorithm, perhaps your computer is not only running your program, but **OTHER** program, basically, it cannot be reproduce

5. This part might be good, but other doesn't

    > The choice of algorithm often depend on the situation, in some situation, the algorithm $A$ might be the best, but other situation doesn't.

6. Dependencies of input

    > In 3-sum problem, when we ask "is there exsist the number which match the 3-sum?", if **YES**, the growing level is **constant**, but if **NOT**, the growing level is $N^3$.

    > In this case, we often decribe the growing level as  $T_w$ which means **Time of WORST** situation, and the $T_{av}$ which means **Time of AVERAGE**

7. Multiable paramater

    > When using the BinarySearch to figure out the *White Name List* problem, the List cotains $N$ numbers, which the Input contains $M$ numbers, the growing level is usually $MlogN$

### 2.2.2 Memory

When in java, the usage of the memory is filled as **the multiple of 8**

#### 2.2.2.1 Object
- Integer
    - Totally 24 bytes
    - 16 bytes of the Object itself (stable)
    - 4 bytes of the int value 
    - reference, which the address of memory, cost 8 bytes (stable)

#### 2.2.2.2 Linked List
- Node(inner class)
    - Totally 40 bytes
    - 16 bytes Object itslef
    - 2 * 8 bytes reference (2 reference)
    - when inner class, need another reference point to the owener, 8 bytes
    - The cost of the data

#### 2.2.2.3 Array

- The Object array
    - 24 bytes header message
        -  16 bytes object cost
        -  4 bytes fill cost

#### 2.2.2.4 String

- 40 bytes
- Object cost, 16 bytes
- reference, 8 bytes
- 3 int, 12 bytes
    - offset 
    - counter 
    - hash 

$\Delta$ The subString
> when you involved the `substring()` method, it does create a new String object, but it doesn't create the `value[]` array, it was contained in the **constant area**

> So, the subString extra memory need is a **constant**

## 2.3 Outlook

- Premature optimization is the root of all evil
    - if the running time is peticularly fast, it is worthless to make the speed ten times faster
- But we **DO NEED** the great algorithm, when we handle the **large-scale** problem, the faster algorithm make more profits.
